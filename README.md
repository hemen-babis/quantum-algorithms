# Quantum Algorithms for Machine Learning

This project focuses on using quantum-based algorithms to enhance machine learning efficiency. Using Qiskit, we implement basic quantum algorithms and integrate them with classical machine learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Qiskit**
- **Linear Algebra (NumPy)**
